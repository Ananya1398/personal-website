            <br /><br />
            I&apos;m a fast-learning Software Engineer with 3.5 years of experience in Backend Development, Web Development, DevOps, and Cloud Security. Most recently, I was an SDE Co-op at Amazon Robotics, and currently I am pursuing my MS in Computer Science at Northeastern University, Boston.
            <br /><br />
            My experience spans developing scalable software solutions for automation, including historical data insights, image processing, cloud security posture management, cloud auditing, and third-party risk management. I&apos;ve also worked with industry-standard frameworks like CIS, NIST, and CSA CCM, contributing to robust cloud security baselines.
            <br /><br />
            I thrive in environments where problem-solving meets creativity, and I look forward to driving solutions that merge cutting-edge technology with seamless user experiences.
